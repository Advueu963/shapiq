# SHAP-IQ: SHAP Interaction Quantification
> An interaction may speak more than a thousand main effects.

Shapley Interaction Quantification (`shapiq`) is a Python package for (1) approximating any-order Shapley interactions, (2) benchmarking game-theoretical algorithms for machine learning, (3) explaining feature interactions of model predictions. `shapiq` extends the well-known [shap](https://github.com/shap/shap) package for both researchers working on game theory in machine learning, as well as the end-users explaining models. SHAP-IQ extends indivdual Shapley values by quantifying the **synergy** effect between entities (aka **players** in the jargon of game theory) like explanatory features, data points, or weak learners in ensemble models. Synergies between players give a more comprehensive view of machine learning models.

# üõ†Ô∏è Install
`shapiq` is intended to work with **Python 3.9 and above**. Installation can be done via `pip`:

```sh
pip install shapiq
```

# ‚≠ê Quickstart
You can use `shapiq` in different ways. If you have a trained model you can rely on the `shapiq.explainer` classes.
If you are interested in the underlying game theoretic algorithms, then check out the `shapiq.approximator` modules.
You can also plot and visualize your interaction scores with `shapiq.plot`.

## üìà Compute k-SII values

Explain your models with Shapley interaction values like the k-SII values:

```python
import shapiq
# load data
X, y = shapiq.load_california_housing(to_numpy=True)
# train a model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50, random_state=42)
model.fit(X, y)
# explain with k-SII interaction scores
explainer = shapiq.TabularExplainer(
    model=model,
    data=X,
    index="k-SII",
    max_order=2
)
interaction_values = explainer.explain(X[0], budget=256)

print(interaction_values)
>> InteractionValues(
>>    index=k-SII, max_order=2, min_order=0, estimated=False,
>>    estimation_budget=256, n_players=8, baseline_value=0.86628,
>>    Top 10 interactions:
>>        (0,): 3.5894835404761913  # main effect for feature 0
>>        (7,): 1.6117512314285711
>>        (0, 1): 0.20849640380952  # interaction for features 0 & 1
>>        (5,): 0.2006931133333336
>>        (2,): 0.1753635657142866
>>        (0, 5): -0.0974019461904
>>        (0, 3): -0.1267195495238
>>        (0, 6): -0.2124500961904
>>        (6, 7): -0.3429407528571
>>        (0, 7): -1.1588948528571
>> )
```

## üìä Visualize your Interactions

One handy way of visualizing interaction scores (up to order 2) are network plots.
You can see an example of such a plot below.
The nodes represent **attribution** scores and the edges represent the **interactions**.
The strength and size of the nodes and edges are proportional to the absolute value of the
attribution scores and interaction scores, respectively.

```python
shapiq.network_plot(
    first_order_values=interaction_values.get_n_order_values(1),
    second_order_values=interaction_values.get_n_order_values(2)
)
```

The pseudo-code above can produce the following plot (here also an image is added):
